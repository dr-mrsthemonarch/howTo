#HowTo Repo.

This repo is setup for installation/compiler instructions I've had to work through to get certain libraries to work on Xcode on my machine. My hope is that people who are novices like myself can find this when they've given up, as well as a place for me to log how I've solved these problems, when I've remembered where I found a solution, I try to provide a link, but usually I just reproduce the answer to avoid deadlinks.
